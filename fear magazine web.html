                <div class="main">The term "skeleton" can refer to several different things, depending on the context. Here are a few common meanings:
                Human Skeleton: The human skeleton is the internal framework of bones that provides structure and support for the body. It consists of over 200 individual bones, which can be categorized into the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, and rib cage) and the appendicular skeleton (limb bones and the bones that connect them to the axial skeleton).
                Animal Skeleton: Animals, like humans, also have skeletons. These can vary greatly in terms of size and complexity. In vertebrate animals, the skeleton provides support, protection, and a framework for muscles and other tissues.
                Plant Skeleton: Some plants have structures that can be referred to as a "skeleton." For example, the leaves of some plants have a network of veins that provide structural support, and the remaining tissue between the veins can be considered as the plant's "skeleton."
                Skeleton Key: In the context of locks and keys, a skeleton key is a type of key that can open many different locks, typically older or simpler locks. It has a basic design that can fit into a variety of locks.
                Skeleton Crew: This term is often used to describe a minimal or essential staff required to keep an organization or operation functioning during a period when most of the regular staff is absent, such as holidays or emergencies.
                Skeleton in the Closet: This is a metaphorical phrase used to describe a hidden or embarrassing secret or a problematic issue that someone is trying to keep concealed
                Skeleton (Anatomy and Physiology): In the context of anatomy and physiology, a skeleton can refer to the basic, simplified structure of an organism or organ that is used for educational or illustrative purposes. It may not represent all the details of the actual structure but serves as a simplified model for learning.
                Skeleton (Framework): In computer programming and web development, a "skeleton" can refer to the basic structure or framework of a website or application. It includes the essential components and layout, which can then be customized and filled in with content.
                The meaning of "skeleton" depends on the specific context in which it is used. If you have a specific question or need more information about a particular aspect of "skeleton," please provide additional details, and I'd be happy to provide more specific information.
